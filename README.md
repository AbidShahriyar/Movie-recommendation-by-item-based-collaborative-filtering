# Movie-recommendation-by-item-based-collaborative-filtering
A movie recommendation engine is built using correlation matrix and item similarity scores from movie ratings data
downloaded from movielens project of grouplens.org

Item-item, item based or item to item, is a kind of collaborative filtering technique used to recommend items through finding
similarity scores based on ratings on those items provided by users. It was invented by Amazon.com and has many advantages over
the pre-existing user based collaborative filtering as it was computationally expensive due to keeping records of all users. Again,
it was easier to game the system.
The Movie_Recommender.ipynb file is a demonstration of a simple process to recommend items to users based on their ratings. As mentioned
in above the dataset was downloaded from grouplens.org as file names: u.data & u.item
